//* Constructor 

// A constructor is special type of method/function that is invoked automatically during the object creation of a class.
// It used to allocate memory to object , initialized the state of object , initialize the data members.
// Constructors let you define initial values for the object's attributes, ensuring that every instance of a class starts with a specific setup. This makes it easy to create objects with different data while keeping the structure consistent.

// Characteristics =>
// 1. It has same name as the class.
// 2. Doesnt return anyting so no return type.
